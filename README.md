# Sonoff-NSPanel-with-ESPHome

In this Github repo you can find my [Sonoff NSPanel](https://sonoff.tech/product/smart-wall-swtich/nspanel/) config with ESPHome and Home Assistant.
This config is based on the [NSPanel-MF](https://github.com/marcfager/nspanel-mf) config from [marcfager](https://github.com/marcfager), with the [color picker config](https://github.com/MMMZZZZ/Random-Stuff/tree/master/Nextion%20HSV%20Test) from [MMMZZZZ](https://github.com/MMMZZZZ).

I want to thank everyone on the [Unofficial Nextion Discord](https://discord.gg/98V7qp4), I couldn't have done this without you!
